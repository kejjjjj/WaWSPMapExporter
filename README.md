# WaWMapSPExporter

**ONLY** for the CoD WaW patch *1.7.1263* (Singleplayer)\
Might have small geometry artifacts as this is almost copy paste from cod4 (and its .map format)


## How to use
1. Download the dll
2. Launch the game
3. Inject the dll
4. Launch any map
5. Write /cm_mapexport into the console
6. If everything was successful, there should be a /map_source/kej/ subdirectory in your game directory
